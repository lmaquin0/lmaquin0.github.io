    <p>The second activity was Tracing Internet Traffic. After reading the article to learn about traceroute and how to use it, then opened Command Prompt on my laptop and ran a tracert command for howtogeek.com. I observed the output, seeing how many hops happened before reaching howtogeek’s servers and the packets’ latencies. After, I used a website to perform a traceroute that maps and visualizes the output, this time for my most used social media, X (formerly known as Twitter). This website helped me see the geography behind my internet usage, and gave me an appreciation for the speed of data. For example, with X, I was only aware of the former Sacramento data center because the new owner tried to move the servers to Portland himself a few years ago. However, the traceroute visualizer showed the last hop in Atlanta, which brought me to discover that X had a data center in Georgia when it was still known as Twitter. Through this activity, I learned that even a quick visit to a website involves multiple hops where packets cross hundreds or thousands of miles, potentially even over oceans. For certain websites, there may even be centers across various locations to which the packets may travel in order to more efficiently serve those who want to reach it. There is no shortage of information that needs to be conveyed to connect to the internet and find a web page, and now I have a better idea of the networks that run this significant process. I can see myself applying this concept to check the source of a problem when I’m unable to reach a website. Using and understanding traceroute would help me recognize when I need to troubleshoot on my end, or report an issue to my ISP or the website administrator.</p>
