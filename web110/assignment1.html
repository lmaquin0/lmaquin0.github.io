    <p>The first activity I completed was IP Addresses and Geolocation. To start, I read the article to which I was directed after clicking the link for “Does IP Address Location (Geolocation) Really Work?”, which gave me instructions on how to change my GPS location on my phone. I reviewed the methods available for the iPhone, then chose iTools to set my location to the Philippines. After, I found my IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, then put these addresses into an IP location finder. The finder identified my true approximate location, though it didn’t have the correct town or zip code. I learned through this activity that GPS location and IP address location are not connected, the former being established through satellite communication and the latter being determined by computer network and device. To completely obfuscate one’s location, multiple tools might be needed. I might apply my knowledge around IP addresses to protect my own privacy online–like changing it with a VPN or simply not disclosing it to others.</p>
