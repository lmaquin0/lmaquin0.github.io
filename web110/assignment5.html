    <p>The first activity I completed was review GCFLearnFree: Pinterest. I reviewed the numbered steps to understand Pinterest, made an account, explored other usersâ€™ profiles, created a board and pins, and adjusted privacy settings. In this activity, I learned about a social media platform that I had not used before, familiarized myself with how to use it, and determined if it had any utility in my own life. I think there are a lot of ways I could apply this in my environment; making a new account on a platform helped me think about how I would evaluate social media for my own ends. As for Pinterest itself, I could definitely use this in the future for gathering and organizing visual inspiration for design and creative projects in my career and personal life.
