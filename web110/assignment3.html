    <p>The first activity I completed was to learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO). After reviewing the article about getting a website on Google, I tried searching for Wikiversity’s Internet Fundamentals/Search Engine page on Google. It showed up, meaning that the search engine spiders of Google had successfully crawled that page. During this activity, I learned about the various methods to ensure your website or content appear in a Google search. In my own life, I might employ this new knowledge about SEO to try to find work, as I hope to work in graphic design or web design. I will likely put up a website to display my work and include contact information; if I want to reach clients or employers in this way, having my page show up on search engines is the first step. The second activity I completed was use the Internet Archive. I first spent some time checking out various historical web page versions on the Wayback Machine, then tried saving a page to the Wayback Machine myself. I chose a page from a game guide website about building a recently released character from a game I play–I thought it would be interesting to go back and see how the page has changed as new equipment and characters are added. This activity gave me some insight into how web design has evolved over the years, which greatly interests me as a graphic designer. I also gained an appreciation for this tool as it preserves websites and pages that may no longer exist at all. In the future, I will definitely use the Wayback Machine as a reference not only for design but for information.</p>
