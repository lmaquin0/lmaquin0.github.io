    <p>The first activity I completed was to learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO). After reviewing the article about getting a website on Google, I tried searching for Wikiversityâ€™s Internet Fundamentals/Search Engine page on Google. It showed up, meaning that the search engine spiders of Google had successfully crawled that page. During this activity, I learned about the various methods to ensure your website or content appear in a Google search. In my own life, I might employ this new knowledge about SEO to try to find work, as I hope to work in graphic design or web design. I will likely put up a website to display my work and include contact information; if I want to reach clients or employers in this way, having my page show up on search engines is the first step.</p>
