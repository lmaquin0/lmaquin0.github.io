    <p>The first activity I did was configure browser extensions and add-ons. I reviewed articles about how to install plug-ins and disable extensions, and used the instructions to check the extensions I currently had. Since I use Google Chrome with two different profiles, one for school and one for personal browsing, I checked both. I culled some unused extensions from my personal profile and researched popular extensions, ultimately deciding to install an adblocker and grammar checker to my school profile. Through this activity, I learned that there are many ways to personalize your experience on a browser. Since everyone has different habits and preferences, there are many offerings through which to comb. This also means these extensions have the means to alter your browser in undesirable ways. I already use some extensions, but try to do so sparingly as I don’t monitor them regularly if they work when I need them to. In the future, I might download more add-ons to better suit me, or replace them with different ones that have improved functionality, like changing my ad blocker. The second activity I did was compare browser HTML5 compatibility. After reviewing an article about HTML5 accessibility across browsers in 2020, I checked a site that tested and scored my browser’s support of HTML5. Through this activity, I learned my Chrome browser supports nearly all of HTML5’s features, with very few missing. I was able to browse the many features that are part of HTML5 and found that most of them were available in some way on the major browsers a few years ago. The holes in these browser’s HTML5 support were based on their support for assistive technology software and navigability by keyboard. For my own learning, having knowledge of the standard set by HTML5 gives me a better understanding of the websites I visit and could help me if I wanted to make my own in the future. Being able to meet these standards ensures that anyone can access a website across different browsers or devices.
