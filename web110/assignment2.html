    <p>The first activity I did was configure browser extensions and add-ons. I reviewed articles about how to install plug-ins and disable extensions, and used the instructions to check the extensions I currently had. Since I use Google Chrome with two different profiles, one for school and one for personal browsing, I checked both. I culled some unused extensions from my personal profile and researched popular extensions, ultimately deciding to install an adblocker and grammar checker to my school profile. Through this activity, I learned that there are many ways to personalize your experience on a browser. Since everyone has different habits and preferences, there are many offerings through which to comb. This also means these extensions have the means to alter your browser in undesirable ways. I already use some extensions, but try to do so sparingly as I donâ€™t monitor them regularly if they work when I need them to. In the future, I might download more add-ons to better suit me, or replace them with different ones that have improved functionality, like changing my ad blocker.</p>
