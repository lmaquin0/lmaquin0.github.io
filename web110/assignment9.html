    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Activity 9 tasked us with writing CSS and applying it in three different ways. I have some previous knowledge of CSS, but learning about the different selectors which can be used to group elements together to apply styles was mostly new to me. Reviewing syntax and the variety of properties in CSS was also useful. I know that in the future my current knowledge of CSS can be used on any web page I may want to build, through external, internal, or inline CSS. As I deepen that knowledge, Iâ€™ll be able to make judgement calls on things like the method I use to apply CSS and utilizing selectors to achieve certain effects.</p>
