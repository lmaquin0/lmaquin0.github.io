    <p>This semester I learned about a wide variety of topics, from web browsers and search engines to database queries. Along the way there were various times where a lightbulb went off that helped me better appreciate the internet I use daily and how to build a webpage. For example, the topic of networks made me consider how we are connected to each other through the web and the protocols in place to ensure everything goes smoothly. Another moment of learning for me was when we covered databasesâ€“the emphasis on data literacy before going into what a database was conveyed to me the importance of understanding the data being handled ahead of managing it. In the future, I definitely want to build my own web page, and I will continue to use the internet. Things like maintaining security and using email will stay relevant later on. The basics I learned for building a web page will also be my foundation for more advanced projects in my future.</p>
