    <p>The first activity I completed was review IP address settings for your local network. I did this on my laptop that runs on Windows 11, so I first reviewed my network settings. After, I opened a command prompt to display my IP address, as well as release and renew it. During this activity, I learned about how to check and change my IP address, and why this might be important to know. In my own life, I might use this knowledge when I’m having connectivity issues–I’m a big proponent of turning things on and off to fix any issues, but I could save some time if the issue is related to the DHCP server. Additionally, if I wanted to host my own website or server, manually setting my IP address would be ideal to ensure people can reach it. The second activity I completed was research and compare license and support costs for Windows, macOS, and Linux. I conducted a few searches on Google to find information on each one. As I already thought, the cost of a “license” for macOS is simply whatever you pay for a Mac device, since it can only be run on Mac devices. During this activity I learned that in the case of Windows 11, a single Pro license is $199, though it seems volume licensing can run cheaper. For Linux, it is free, though there are paid versions that run subscriptions and server licenses for anything from dirt cheap to over $1000 a year. I might apply this knowledge to my own life if I were to build a PC, which I am interested in doing one day. Research like this would inform my budget and goals for such a project.</p>
