    <p>The first activity I completed was review IP address settings for your local network. I did this on my laptop that runs on Windows 11, so I first reviewed my network settings. After, I opened a command prompt to display my IP address, as well as release and renew it. During this activity, I learned about how to check and change my IP address, and why this might be important to know. In my own life, I might use this knowledge when I’m having connectivity issues–I’m a big proponent of turning things on and off to fix any issues, but I could save some time if the issue is related to the DHCP server. Additionally, if I wanted to host my own website or server, manually setting my IP address would be ideal to ensure people can reach it.
