    <h1>Assignment 10</h1>
    <p>During this assignment, I learned how to display multimedia files on an HTML webpage. There is a different tag for each type of media, which is key to ensuring they properly appear on the page. One thing that was curious to me was that my multimedia files were not showing up on my site like I expected, until I realized the path was not completely correct. In the future, I will very likely want to display different kinds of media on the websites I may create and doing this activity has taught me how to do so, as well as reminded me of important steps to look out for in the process.</</p>
