    <p>The first activity I completed was Screen Sharing / Remote Desktop. After researching the remote desktop applications Chrome Remote Desktop; Quick Assist; and VNC, I tried using Chrome Remote Desktop. It was easy to install and access my personal desktop on my sister’s laptop, and I moved a couple things around to check if it worked. During this activity, I learned about how to remotely connect to another computer and discovered some potential uses for it. I could definitely see myself using this now as a student if I did not have my laptop with me to complete schoolwork or share things with others. The second activity I completed was Intellectual Property. In this activity, I reviewed the RIAA: About Piracy page and did some research into illegal peer-to-peer file sharing. From this research, I learned a lot about how illegal copying can be rather easy and seem innocuous, but have real consequences for the owners and creators of the work. In my own life, I would apply this knowledge toward finding ways to watch movies, tv shows, and listen to music from authorized sources. I’d also apply the principle of not copying and sharing things to smaller artists and creators who may not have the power to fight piracy.</p>
