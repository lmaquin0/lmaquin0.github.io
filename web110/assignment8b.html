    <p>The first activity I completed was use the WEBAim: Contrast Checker. I picked out some colors from websites I frequently used and found that they passed the contrast check, then tried adjusting colors myself. From there, I learned what the minimum color contrast ratio to pass standards for graphical objects and different types of text looks like. In the future, I might use my knowledge of color contrast to design my own website, or to identify issues with a site that I visit. Additionally, I might use WEBAimâ€™s tool to check the exact number if I had to work with a set palette. The second activity I completed was use the Paletton website to identify good color schemes. I experimented with various color schemes, looking for palettes that were interesting and had contrast without looking harsh. During this activity, I learned about a useful tool for color theory and putting together colors on screens. Since I already had some knowledge of mixing colors for physical paints, using Paletton showed me how this changes for RGB displays and provided hexcodes for the colors I found. In the future, I might use this tool for creative projects, not just for digital pursuits but even with traditional mediums.</p>
