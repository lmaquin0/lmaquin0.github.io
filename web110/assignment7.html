    <p>The first activity I completed was practice web browser safety. During this activity, I made sure I had the latest version of Chrome, managed my add-ons; saved information; and cookies, and tested Incognito mode. As I completed the activity, I learned about the various ways one can ensure their security on their browser–and that many of these are simple steps that can be performed regularly. Since I am a regular browser, I can definitely apply this to my life since I visit many websites, many of which require logging in. In the future, I might start clearing my cache and checking my autoform settings more frequently. The second activity I completed was test your firewall using a testing service. I used the website linked in the activity, GRC ShieldsUP! to conduct a few tests including a probe of internet common ports and check for Windows file sharing vulnerabilities. In the end, my laptop was deemed very secure by the tests. From this activity, I learned how to test my device for vulnerabilities as well as how potential weaknesses can be exploited from the explanations of my results. In the future, I might increase my security if I want to share files or want to check if I suspect there is a vulnerability; using a tool like this is helpful in gauging my firewall’s effectiveness.</p>
