    <p>The first activity I completed was practice web browser safety. During this activity, I made sure I had the latest version of Chrome, managed my add-ons; saved information; and cookies, and tested Incognito mode. As I completed the activity, I learned about the various ways one can ensure their security on their browserâ€“and that many of these are simple steps that can be performed regularly. Since I am a regular browser, I can definitely apply this to my life since I visit many websites, many of which require logging in. In the future, I might start clearing my cache and checking my autoform settings more frequently.</p>
