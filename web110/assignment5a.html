    <p>The first activity I completed was review GCFLearnFree: Pinterest. I reviewed the numbered steps to understand Pinterest, made an account, explored other users’ profiles, created a board and pins, and adjusted privacy settings. In this activity, I learned about a social media platform that I had not used before, familiarized myself with how to use it, and determined if it had any utility in my own life. I think there are a lot of ways I could apply this in my environment; making a new account on a platform helped me think about how I would evaluate social media for my own ends. As for Pinterest itself, I could definitely use this in the future for gathering and organizing visual inspiration for design and creative projects in my career and personal life. The second activity I completed was review Smart Insights: The Honeycomb Model. After reading up on the honeycomb model, I evaluated several of the most popular social media platforms and sites. I considered how the purpose of a platform changed how they approached certain building blocks of the honeycomb model. For example, not every YouTube user may necessarily hold a strong identity on the site because the most common form of self-promotion is several-minute-long videos; it’s a higher bar for entry compared to a brief tweet or posting a picture. During this activity, I learned that there are certain essential aspects of social media sites that may be executed differently across platforms. In my own life, I might use this knowledge to judge which social media sites fit my needs–whether its for furthering my career, sharing with friends, or making new connections.</p>
