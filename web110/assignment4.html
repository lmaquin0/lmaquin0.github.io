    <p>The first activity I completed was view email message headers. After reviewing pages about email spoofing and analyzing email headers on Google, I tried tracing a marketing message from a local business on my personal email using Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader. The results from the Toolbox confirmed that the email passed Google’s authentication and spam filters, and also showed me that the business used marketing platform Mailchimp to send it. In this activity, I learned about the possibilities of email spoofing, which notably can be used maliciously, and how to find the source of a message from its header. I might apply this to my own life when I am trying to connect with others or make purchases online–communication and marketing happen over email, but if something seems suspicious, I can trace any email sent to me.</p>
