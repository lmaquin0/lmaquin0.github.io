    <p>The first activity I completed was view email message headers. After reviewing pages about email spoofing and analyzing email headers on Google, I tried tracing a marketing message from a local business on my personal email using Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader. The results from the Toolbox confirmed that the email passed Google’s authentication and spam filters, and also showed me that the business used marketing platform Mailchimp to send it. In this activity, I learned about the possibilities of email spoofing, which notably can be used maliciously, and how to find the source of a message from its header. I might apply this to my own life when I am trying to connect with others or make purchases online–communication and marketing happen over email, but if something seems suspicious, I can trace any email sent to me. The second activity I completed was use internet mailing lists. I researched Internet mailing lists and newsletters, signed up for one, and read up on bulk email procedure and restrictions. Something I learned that caught my eye was the guidelines for having unsubscribe links, including one-click unsubscribe and RFC 8058. On Gmail, one-click unsubscribe headers only appear for messages that pass certain eligibility checks. I personally receive emails from a variety of senders and had only recently noticed some of them implemented one-click unsubscribe. Overall, its reassuring to discover that there have been efforts to standardize these guidelines, as it makes my experience smoother as one who receives messages. As an email user, I might use mailing lists to help me stay up to date. I also might end up designing or writing for a mailing list, and understanding the restrictions surrounding them would help in the process of creation.</p>
