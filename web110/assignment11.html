    <h2>Lesson Summary</h2>
    <p>During this activity, I reviewed the Northwind database sample and answered questions based on the database information. The questions had me navigating through tables and keeping track of relationships between different entities to reach the correct answers. The diagram was helpful in checking how certain attributes were connected. In doing this, I imagined myself as the database management system (DBMS) performing retrieval and even doing some additional processing of data, like counting the amount of orders that meet certain criteria and finding their total cost. Ultimately I learned about the tasks and queries that a DBMS undertakes, as well as familiarized myself with the entity-relationship model that is commonly implemented in databases.</p>
