    <p>For this assignment, I used HTML to create an unordered list with references to my assignment files on GitHub. Since I am familiar yet rusty with HTML basics, this assignment ensured I am prepared for the next one. I had forgotten the structure to reference files, so I definitely needed that reminder. In the future, I can apply my knowledge of lists and links in HTML to arrange information and improve navigation on a website. Since I am interested in deepening my knowledge of HTML and potentially designing a website for myself or even others, I will surely continue to use it later.</p>
